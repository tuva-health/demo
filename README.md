# The Tuva Project Demo

## 🧰 What does this project do?

This demo provides a quick and easy way to run the Tuva Project 
Package in a dbt project with synthetic data for 1k patients loaded as dbt seeds.

To set up the Tuva Project with your own claims data or to better understand what the Tuva Project does, please review the ReadMe in [The Tuva Project](https://github.com/tuva-health/the_tuva_project) package for a detailed walkthrough and setup.

For information on the data models check out our [Docs](https://thetuvaproject.com/).

## ✅ How to get started

### Pre-requisites
You only need one thing installed:
1. [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/) - a fast Python package manager. Installation is simple and OS-agnostic:
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```
   Or on Windows:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   ```

**Note:** This demo uses DuckDB as the database, so you don't need to configure a connection to an external data warehouse. Everything is configured and ready to go!

### Getting Started
Complete the following steps to run the demo:

1. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repo to your local machine or environment.
1. In the project directory, install Python dependencies and set up the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```
1. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   # or on Windows:
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
1. Run `dbt deps` to install the Tuva Project package:
   ```bash
   dbt deps
   ```
1. Run `dbt build` to run the entire project with the built-in sample data:
   ```bash
   dbt build
   ```

The `profiles.yml` file is already included in this repo and pre-configured for DuckDB, so no additional setup is needed!

### Using uv commands
You can also run dbt commands directly with `uv run` without activating the virtual environment:
```bash
uv run dbt deps
uv run dbt build
```
